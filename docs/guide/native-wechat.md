# Native Wechat

Native Wechat is a TurboModule for supporting native APIs on Android and iOS.

## Motivation

Most developers using React Native to build apps are not equipped with native developing skills, not to mention connecting their apps with WeChat.

Especially, WeChat OpenSDK is something pain in the ass because of [shitty docs](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) where lots of APIs are not clear and intuitive. To help developers using React Native, I tried as much as possible to create this library. And I hope you benefit from this and be less frustrated with WeChat.

## Why

- Native Wechat is new, and many libraries like it are no longer maintained and keep up with the latest WeChat.
- Native Wechat supports both legacy and new React Native architecture.
- Native Wechat is a TurboModule that supports lazy loading, allowing for faster app startup.
- Supports TypeScript for better intellisense and easy-to-check typing errors.
- All Apis are promisified.

## Support

If you have trouble using this library, do not hesitate to open an issue. I am always here to help.
